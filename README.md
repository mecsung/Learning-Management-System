## General info
The manual process of enrolling and grading can be challenging and inefficient. It isn't easy to achieve efficiency and reliability using manual work. This manual process is very inconsistent, requires more time, and leaves a lot of room for errors. Furthermore, it takes more effort and physical space to keep track of the students' documents, keep details secure, and it is hard to make changes.

This is why the developers came up with the idea of putting the entire process into a system that will become seamless with a centralized system in place. This system is a new and self-contained product that combines enrollment and grading systems; both happen in one platform for better overall system functionality. This system will integrate all activities involved in the entire grading and enrollment process. The system will accurately and consistently report the progress and achievement of students to the institution.  It will also help the growing necessity for the University to enhance their mechanisms for better serving the student's inquiries.
